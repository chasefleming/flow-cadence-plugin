This plugin allows you to import `.cdc` Cadence files directly into your project, making Flow blockchain scripts and transactions easily accessible in a Webpack-based setup. Additionally, it resolves any TypeScript type errors for `.cdc` imports, providing smooth integration with TypeScript projects.
